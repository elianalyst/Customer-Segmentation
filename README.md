# ðŸ“Š Customer Segmentation Using Machine Learning

## Project Overview  
This project segments customers from a telecommunications company using **K-means clustering** to uncover groups of similar individuals. These insights enable **targeted marketing**, **personalized product recommendations**, and **customer retention strategies**. By understanding which customers are similar, the company can improve satisfaction and maximize profitability through relationship management tactics.

**Research Question**: What customer segments emerge from analyzing shared behaviors and attributes?

## Methodology  
- **K-means Clustering** grouped customers using demographic and account data.  
- **Visualization** included 2D and 3D cluster plots to assess clustering quality and interpret customer segments.

## Key Findings  
- **Four distinct customer segments** were identified, each with unique age, income, and monthly charge patterns.
- Customized service recommendations and relationship strategies were developed for each segment based on its charecteristics.

## Technologies Used  
- Python  
- scikit-learn
- mpl_toolkits (3D plotting)
